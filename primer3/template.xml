    This file is intended to serve as a medium for users to specify parameters to the primer designing tool.
    DO NOT MODIFY ANY TAGS, IF YOU DO IT WILL LEAD TO PROGRAMME CRAHSES.
    All tags are critical for the parsing logic of the programme.
    Add the parameters that you would like to specify within the '>' and '<' of the tag of interest.
    e.g. If you want primers with a length no less than 32 bases, edit the following field like this:
    <PrimerMinimumLength></PrimerMinimumLength> to <PrimerMinimumLength>32</PrimerMinimumLength>
    If you are satisfied with the defaults, just leave the tags empty. Do not ever add anything unnecessary
    or inappropriate.
